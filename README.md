## Installation
<a id='installation'></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
<a id='projectmotivation'></a>
For this project, I was interested in using The Movies Database to find out;
1. Which movie has generated the maximum & minimum revenue?
2. Which movie generated the highest & lowest profits?
3. Which genre has the highest release of movies?
4. Which is the most popular genre?
5. How does the year of release impact profits?
6. In the past years, what has been the average runtime for each year?
7. Which movies have generated a profit greater than the average profit?

## File Descriptions
<a id='filedescriptions'></a>
There is one notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
1. tmdb-movies.csv - Contains the movie details for top 100 movies on TMDb.

## Results
<a id='results'></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://amankumbhani.medium.com/this-analysis-will-make-you-take-a-trip-with-airbnb-3d2aca5a5fc6).
